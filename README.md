## Overview

Welcome to the README for our collaborative project developed at Telecom SudParis! This project, undertaken by groups of three, focused on implementing the U-NET architecture. Our work involved gaining practical insights into U-NET, understanding its implementation in code, tracking loss, interpreting training metrics, and delving into the intricacies of data pre-processing for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

## Team Members

### 1. Member 1 - Theo Danielou

### 2. Member 2 - Brieuc Popper

### 3. Member 3 - Thibault Kiewsky

## Learning Focus

Our project at Telecom SudParis allowed us to dive into the following key areas:

- **U-NET Implementation:** Understanding the architecture and practical implementation of U-NET.
  
- **Code Implementation:** Translating theoretical knowledge into code, with a focus on tracking loss and interpreting training metrics.

- **Data Pre-processing:** Exploring data pre-processing techniques essential for optimizing CNN performance.

- **TensorFlow and Keras:** Gaining proficiency in using TensorFlow and Keras, enhancing our ability to solve common bugs in projects of this nature.

- **Binary and 3-Class Segmentation:** Implementing both binary and three-class segmentation models to broaden our understanding and application skills.

- **Working on GPU Clusters with SSH:** Acquiring practical experience in working on GPU clusters through SSH, including Linux proficiency and associated skills.

## Sample results

The above image shows on the left the image that our network gets as input, and then group truth and the masks that it predicts.

Below is an example with 3-class segmentation (left lung and right lung)

## Technologies Used

Our project leveraged the following technologies:

- **Programming Language:** Python
  
- **Frameworks:** TensorFlow, Keras, (and matplotlib...)


## The different python files are here but need to be a bit reorganized. The weights and the training data are not included in the repo.
